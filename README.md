# 👩‍⚕️ Maternal Health Risk Prediction

![ML Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Machine%20Learning-Healthcare-blue?style=for-the-badge)  
A **machine learning-powered Streamlit app** for predicting **maternal health risk levels** (Low, Medium, High) based on clinical data.  

---

## 📌 Overview
Maternal health complications are a major concern worldwide. Early prediction of maternal risk can save lives.  

This project uses **machine learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on the *Maternal Health Risk Dataset* to classify patients into risk categories.  

The app allows healthcare professionals to:  
- Input patient details (Age, BP, BS, Body Temp, Heart Rate).  
- Get instant predictions of **maternal risk level**.  
- View model performance and feature importance.
